# Basic Keylogger Simulation (Educational)

## Description
This project simulates a basic keylogger in a controlled and ethical environment
to understand how keystroke logging works. The program captures user keystrokes
locally with explicit permission and stores them in a log file.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand keystroke capturing
- Learn risks of keylogging attacks
- Study ethical implications

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pynput
python keylogger.py
